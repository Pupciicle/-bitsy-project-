**blu parking**

the part i was thinking of is blu (the from rio) when he was driving in the car and trying to avoid objects to get to ready to open shop with his owner.


**idea/player exprince**

my idea for this is to have the player avoid blocks/go thur differnt paths until they make it to a "parking spot" having them go to another room to where the player has to find a key to open a "computer" which would be a door. i thought it would be good for the player to find a key becuase of the fact blu unlocks the computer with a password.

1)player would go thur paths/blocks maybe like a maze (this is becuase of the part in rio where he went thur a table and avoided differnt things to get to the little parking space he had) 
2)player would make it to the door (this will sysmbols the stairs he went down)
3)player will try and find a key
4)player takes it to the computer and game is over
